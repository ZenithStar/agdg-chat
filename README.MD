# AGDG chat
This is a proof of concept authoritive multiplayer 3rd person movement + chat room demo using [Rivet](rivet.gg).

## Installation
The Rivet .dll is too big to include in the repo, so it needs to be manually installed from assetlib
Alternatively, run: (Requires godot in PATH) 
```
godot --headless -s plug.gd install
```
